    question: "Are you a staff augmentation company or a dev agency?",
    answer: "We’re both. As a staff augmentation company with deep Web3 expertise, we can either embed our developers directly into your team or lead entire delivery tracks. The model flexes to fit your project and internal structure."
  },
  {
    question: "What’s the difference between team augmentation and full outsourcing?",
    answer: "Team augmentation means our developers work as part of your existing setup - your tools, your processes, your sprints. Outsourcing hands off full control. With our team augmentation services, you stay in charge while scaling faster and smarter."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle communication and time zones?",
    answer: "We work with clients globally and adapt to your preferred communication tools and hours. From 15 years of experience, a few hours’ overlap each day is enough for fruitful collaboration in software development."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure quality and alignment with our team?",
    answer: "Every developer is vetted for both technical skill and collaboration style. We conduct regular check-ins, gather feedback early, and stay responsive throughout the engagement to make sure things click - technically and culturally."
  },
  {
    question: "Is staff augmentation more cost-effective than hiring full-time?",
    answer: "Yes - especially for early-stage or fast-moving teams. You skip the recruitment cycle, reduce long-term overhead, and avoid the need to retrain or overhire full-time roles. With staff augmentation, you can access senior-level talent when needed - and only for as long as required."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the typical rates for Web3 team augmentation?",
    answer: "Rates vary depending on role, seniority, and engagement scope - but we’re transparent from the start. Once we understand your needs, we’ll provide options that balance quality, speed, and budget."
  },
  {
    question: "What if the assigned developer isn’t a good fit?",
    answer: "No worries - we’ll replace them quickly and smoothly. Our priority is ensuring you have people who deliver results and gel with your workflow."
  },
  {
    question: "What roles can you provide through staff augmentation?",
    answer: "We offer blockchain developers, smart contract engineers, full-stack builders, and product leads. Our team includes Borislav Itskov and Kaloyan Kosev - recipients of an Ethereum Foundation’s ERC-4337 grant and winners of the ETH Prague hackathon - and Gergana Mihaylova, who’s led UX innovation in smart account onboarding. You get proven talent, ready to ship."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the benefits of Web3 staff augmentation over traditional hiring?",
    answer: "You skip the long hiring cycles, get top-tier talent on demand, and can scale up or down as needed-no long-term commitments or overhead."
