    question: "Do you offer fixed-scope packages for consulting engagements?",

    question: "Can you help with both technical and business strategy?",
    answer: "Yes. Our background spans engineering, product, and go-to-market. We connect the dots between your tech choices and your business goals — whether you’re designing a protocol, launching a token, or figuring out your next growth phase."
  },
  {
    question: "What problems does Web3 consultancy solve?",
