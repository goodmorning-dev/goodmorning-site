        question: "What do your Web3 technical auditing services include?",
        answer: "Our Web3 technical auditing services assess everything from smart contract security and protocol logic to infrastructure risks and development processes. We evaluate the full technical stack - surfacing vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, and blockers to scalability or compliance."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you provide Web3 smart contract auditing as part of your services?",
        answer: "Yes. Web3 smart contract auditing is a core part of what we do. We analyze contract logic, test for common and edge-case vulnerabilities, review permission structures, and offer optimization suggestions - all with a focus on real-world risk."
    },
    {
        question: "What is IT due diligence in the Web3 context?",
        answer: "IT due diligence for Web3 goes beyond traditional audits. It includes reviewing smart contract integrity, infrastructure choices, third-party dependencies, compliance with decentralized governance models, and the resilience of your tech stack under real usage."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you offer vendor or third-party software assessments?",
        answer: "Absolutely. We evaluate the reliability, security, and maintainability of any external APIs, tools, or off-chain components your system depends on - identifying risks before they become critical vulnerabilities."
    },
    {
        question: "What does the final audit report include?",
        answer: "Our reports are clear, structured, and actionable. You’ll get a breakdown of findings (ranked by severity), technical analysis, code samples where relevant, and prioritized next steps - whether it’s remediation, optimization, or strategic rework."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you offer follow-up support after the audit?",
        answer: "Yes. We don’t just point out the issues - we help you fix them. We can retest after patches, offer implementation guidance, or even provide hands-on engineering support if you need help addressing the findings."
    },
    {
        question: "How much does a technical audit cost?",
        answer: "Pricing depends on the project’s complexity, size, and urgency. We provide a transparent quote upfront-no hidden fees."
    },
    {
        question: "Are your audits suitable for technical due diligence before investments or M&A?",
        answer: "Our technical due diligence services are built for exactly that - giving investors, M&A teams, and founders a clear view of the tech behind a project. We assess code quality, architecture, team maturity, and infrastructure risk to help you evaluate deals quickly and clearly."
