    question: "How do you price your services - fixed cost, hourly, retainer?",

  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to have technical knowledge to work with your team?",
    answer: "Not at all. Many of our clients are non-technical founders or business leads. We keep communication clear, guide you through technical decisions, and make sure you’re never left in the dark."
  },
  {
    question: "What technologies do you use?",
    answer: "We’re stack-agnostic, but most of our work is on Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains. We build with Solidity, TypeScript, React, Node.js, and work with L2s like Optimism, Base, and Arbitrum. We also handle multi-chain integrations, off-chain infra, and wallet tech when needed."
