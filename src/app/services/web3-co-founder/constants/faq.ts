    question: "What is a Web3 technical co-founder, and how do you fill that role?",
    answer: "A Web3 technical co-founder is part strategist, part engineer, and part product lead - someone who helps you turn your idea into a real, working product. At goodmorning, we fill that role by owning everything from architecture decisions and dev team management to MVP execution and long-term scaling."
  },
  {
    question: "Is hiring a Web3 technical co-founder better than a full-time CTO?",
    answer: "A Web3 technical co-founder is a partner that can wear many hats, work with different technologies, and scale resources up or down dynamically. You engage with a company rather than a single person, gaining access to a broader talent pool, institutional knowledge, and continuity - advantages a lone full-time CTO typically can’t provide."
  },
  {
    question: "Will you also hire and manage my dev team?",
    answer: "Yes. We bring in the core development talent, and if there’s a gap in expertise or need for a larger squad, we can recruit, vet, and lead new hires to match your goals. We can also blend seamlessly with an existing dev team. Our focus is on building the right team with agile workflows and technical oversight built in."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I still need a designer or PM alongside this service?",
    answer: "Not necessarily. Many engagements include UI/UX and PM capacity through goodmorning, but we’re flexible. If you already have people in place, we’ll collaborate and integrate seamlessly."
  },
  {
    question: "How early should I bring in a technical co-founder?",
    answer: "The earlier, the better. Technical decisions made in the first few weeks often define your product’s scalability and viability. Having someone hands-on from day one reduces costly mistakes and accelerates your time to market."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I only need short-term help or MVP-level leadership?",
    answer: "That’s exactly where our Web3 MVP development services come in. If you’re not ready for long-term technical leadership, we can help you build and launch an MVP first - and revisit your hiring needs after traction."
  },
  {
    question: "What does a Web3 technical co-founder actually do?",
    answer: "They lead everything from smart contract design and protocol selection to assembling and managing a Web3 dev team. It’s a hybrid role that blends strategic thinking with deep technical execution - especially critical in complex environments like DeFi, infrastructure, or multi-chain systems."
  },
  {
    question: "What do Web3 technical co-founder terms include, and how do they differ from consulting?",
    answer: "Web3 technical co-founder terms may include equity and token allocations, with specifics set case by case based on role, contribution, and project stage. Terms are flexible, but co-founder implies long-term dedication, not standard consulting."
